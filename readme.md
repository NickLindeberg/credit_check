# Questions

1. What are you proud of? I utilized my peers to help me with my projects while helping others as well.  I never asked my peers to "show me what you did".  I always asked them to explain the concepts.  Though i deleted it, my pseudo code was quite useful.  

1. What do you need to improve?  I need to work on remembering basic syntax.  I will be spending time studying the basics in the coming weeks to make sure I have them down.  I could use some work on writing a test code first.  

1. What questions do you still have?  I am still a bit shaky on the GitHub portion of this project.  I think I completed it correctly but i'm not entirely sure.  

# Rubric

## Functionality - 3

Notes:

- [3] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [X] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [X] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [X] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [X] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [X] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design - 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [X] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [X] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [X] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines #for the most part.  
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 2

Notes:

The student(s):

- [X] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [X] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [X] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass -I didn't know how to write a test when this project started.  
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests - We haven't gone over this yet

## Version Control - 2

Notes:

The student(s):

- [X] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [X] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
